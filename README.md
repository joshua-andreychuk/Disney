# BYOM - Build Your Own Model

# Overview
This project is an interactive web application developed using Streamlit. It enables users to:
- Upload a CSV file.
- Select a target variable from the uploaded dataset.
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model, choosing between Linear Regression and Decision Tree.

# Features
- Data Preprocessing: Utilizes pandas for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Implements model training and evaluation using scikit-learn. Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R^2 Score.
- Dynamic Test-Train Split: Allows users to select the test-train split ratio for model training, enhancing flexibility in data analysis.
- Model Selection: Users can choose between Linear Regression and Decision Tree models for their data.
